    "The American professional gambler [Bill Benter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Benter) is said to have made earned nearly $1 billion through the development of one of the most successful analysis computer software programs in the horse racing market.\n",

    "The [YouTube Video by Ken Jee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEeUR8UDy-s) outlines how he did it, how difficult it was, and discusses whether it is likely to be able to replicate this feat today (hint: Ken thinks it highly unlikely for a number of reasons).\n",

    "Inspired by video, this notebook examines the possibility of replicating Bill's success using data from modern day UK races.\n",
